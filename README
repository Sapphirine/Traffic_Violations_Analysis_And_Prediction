All files must be executed in pyspark with the

>>>execfile("path_to_file")

The first python file to be executed is the CreateDataframe.py. It creates a dataframe of the dataset.
The files below have to do with the first part of the analysis and must be executed after the execution of the CreateDataframe.py because they use the dataset dataframe:

-Age.py
-Age23Top5Violations.py
-Age21_23.py
-GenderPieChart.py
-PhoneViolations.py
-State.py
-Years.py
-Month.py
-Top10Violations.py

The files below have to do with the first part of the prediction:

-PredictGender.py
-PredictAge.py
-PredictAge21_25.py

*Remember to change the path of the dataset
